## CascableCore Distribution

This repository contains distribution builds of the CascableCore framework from version 10.0 for use with the Swift Package Manager (SPM).

Despite the name of the distribution method, the framework is fully compatible with Objective-C. If you're using CascableCore with Swift, we recommend doing so via the [CascableCoreSwift](https://github.com/cascable/cascablecore-swift) package, which contains some great Swift-y additions to CascableCore.

For older releases of the framwork, see the [CascableCore Binaries](https://github.com/Cascable/cascablecore-binaries) repo.

### Resources

- For more information on the CascableCore product, including getting a trial license, see the [Cascable Developer Portal](https://developer.cascable.se/).

- The best starting point for working with the SDK is by seeing CascableCore in action by checking out the [CascableCore Demo Projects](https://github.com/Cascable/cascablecore-demo) repository. You'll need a trial license for it to do anything useful!

- Next, our [Getting Started With CascableCore](https://github.com/Cascable/cascablecore-demo/blob/master/Getting%20Started%20With%20CascableCore.md) document contains discussion about the CascableCore APIs and concepts in the order in which you're likely to encounter them. These APIs and concepts are equally important for both Objective-C and Swift developers.
