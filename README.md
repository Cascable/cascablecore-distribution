## CascableCore Distribution

This repository contains distribution builds of the CascableCore framework from version 10.0 for use with the Swift Package Manager (SPM).

Despite the name of the distribution method, the framework is fully compatible with Objective-C. If you're using CascableCore with Swift, we recommend doing so via the [CascableCoreSwift](https://github.com/cascable/cascablecore-swift) package, which contains some great Swift-y additions to CascableCore.

For older releases of the framwork, see the [CascableCore Binaries](https://github.com/Cascable/cascablecore-binaries) repo.
